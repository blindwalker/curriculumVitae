# curriculumVitae

This is a little résumé Android-App I made.
The server needed for login can be found here: 
https://github.com/blindwalker/curriculumVitae-NodeServer

It also serves as a sample implementation of my mkropfVolley lib
(see here: https://github.com/blindwalker/mkropfVolley)
The LoginActivity and WSUser classes make use of this library.
